# Frontend Input Validator

The Frontend Input Validator is a Javascript library to be used in the Frontend of your website. The objective of this library is to provide a simple, easy to use and low code system for validating text or file inputs in your website Frontend interface. Which is very common in all types of websites, such as registration forms for example.

This library, when used in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/marcos4503/backend-input-validator" target="_blank">Backend Input Validator</a>, provides EXTREMELY easy way to validate user/client inputs in the Frontend or Backend of your website.

# How it works?

This library works quite simply. What you must do is instantiate an object of type `InputValidator` informing the ID of an Input Field on your page and the validation parameters (such as whether to allow an empty field, maximum number of characters, special characters allowed, etc).

Once this is done, the `InputValidator` object will be linked with the Input Field and will check if the field is valid, AUTOMATICALLY, whenever the user interacts with the Field or types something in it. You can register a Callback on the instantiated `InputValidator` object to receive automatic validation of the linked Input Field. At any time, you can also easily check whether the field is valid or not.

# Understand the basics before starting

When you have fields for User Input you usually expect to receive a text input (`STRING`), a number (`INT` or `FLOAT`) or a file (`FILE`). Therefore, when instantiating an object of type `InputValidator`, you need to inform the ID to target Input Field to be valided, the type of value you expect to obtain from that Input Field and, you must inform the validation parameters. See the code below as an example...

```javascript
//on HTML...
<input type="text" id="nickNameField" />

//on Javascript...
var nickNameValidation = new InputValidator("nickNameField", "STRING", '{ "allowEmpty":false }');
```

As you can see in the example code above, we have the text Field for the user to enter the Nickname. As we expect to get a text value, we inform the `STRING` type when instantiating the `InputValidator` object. But if we have an Age Field for example, we expect to get an integer numerical value, as in the example below...

```javascript
//on HTML...
<input type="number" id="ageField" />

//on Javascript...
var ageValidation = new InputValidator("ageField", "INT", '{ "allowEmpty":false, "minNumberValue":0 }');
```

These are currently the value types supported for validation by this library...

- STRING
- INT
- FLOAT
- FILE

Now let's pay attention to the validation parameters. Validation parameters work like "rules" that you define for an object of type `InputValidator`, so that it can validate the linked Input Field and say if it respects the rules, being VALID, or if it does not respect any rules, being INVALID. For example, if we want to validate a Name field, we can instantiate the `InputValidator` object as follows...

```javascript
//on HTML...
<input type="text" id="nameField" />

//on Javascript...
var nameFieldValidation = new InputValidator("nameField", "STRING", 
    '{ 
        "allowEmpty":false,
        "maxChars":80,
        "allowNumbers": false
    }');
```

As you can see, the validation parameters are informed to the `InputValidator` object in JSON format. When instantiating the `InputValidator` object above, to validate the Name field, we use the `allowEmpty` parameter to say that we don't want an empty field, the `maxChars` parameter to say that the maximum number of characters must be 80 and the `allowNumbers` parameter to say that we do not allow numbers in this field. So, the `InputValidator` object will only consider the Name Field valid if the content typed by the user respects all these parameters.

Notice that we created a validation for the Name Field easily, just using the validation parameters and so we no longer need to create that bunch of lines of Javascript code to do this validation. But ahead, you will see all validation parameters supported by this library!

Now that we understand how to instantiate the `InputValidator` object to link it to an Input Field, we just need to understand how to get the answer to know if the Field is valid or not.

To get the answer if the field is valid or not, you need to use method `SetOnValidateCallback()` of the instantiated `InputValidator` object. In this method you must register a function with a code that you want to execute whenever validation is done by `InputValidator`. As previously mentioned, the `InputValidator` object will AUTOMATICALLY validate the linked Field whenever something is typed, erased, or whenever the user interacts with that field (clicking, leaving focus, etc).

Right after validating, the `InputValidator` object will execute the function that you registered in `SetOnValidateCallback()`, passing a parameter containing a `BOOL` value indicating whether the linked Field is valid or not. See the example code below...

```javascript
/*
 * Step 1:
 * First we instantiate the InputValidator object informing everything necessary to validation...
*/
var nameFieldValidation = new InputValidator("nameField", "STRING", 
    '{ 
        "allowEmpty":false,
        "maxChars":80,
        "allowNumbers": false
    }');

/*
 * Step 2:
 * Now, we register a callback function to get the answer saying if the field is valid or not
 * whenever it is changed or interacted with
*/
nameFieldValidation.SetOnValidateCallback(function(isInputValid){
    if (isInputValid == true)                                    //<- If the field is VALID...
        console.log("The NAME field is valid!");
    if (isInputValid == false)                                   //<- If the field is INVALID...
        console.log("The NAME field is invalid!");
});
```

It's that! After executing these two steps, the `InputValidator` object will automatically validate the linked Field whenever the user interacts or types something in it. The answer will be given to the function you register in `SetOnValidateCallback()` so you can run whatever logic you want!

<b>There's something else!</b> You don't have to wait just for the response returned to your registered function to know if the Field is valid or not. You can also use the `isTheAssociatedFieldValid()` method of the `InputValidator` object to find out if the linked Field is currently valid or not.

The `isTheAssociatedFieldValid()` method will force a validation of the linked Field and will return you a `BOOL` value indicating whether the linked Field is currently valid or not. But before using this method, know that it will ONLY WORK if you have already instantiated an object of type `InputValidator` and registered a function using `SetOnValidateCallback()` method. See example below...

```javascript
//Instancing and registering the callback function...
var nameFieldValidation = new InputValidator("nameField", "STRING", '{ "allowEmpty":false }');
nameFieldValidation.SetOnValidateCallback(function(isInputValid){ 
    //... 
});


//Now, to check if the field is currently valid, any time...
var isNameFieldValidNow = nameFieldValidation.isTheAssociatedFieldValid();
```

This is the basics you need to understand about this library! In the next topics you will see all types of Input Types supported by the library, an example code to validate each type of Input Type and <b>also all validation parameters available for you to use!</b>

# Supported Input Types
